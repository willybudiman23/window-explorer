# Window Explorer FE

## üöÄ Tech Stack
- **Bun** `1.2.7`
- **Vite**
- **Vue 3**
- **Vue Router**
- **Axios**
- **Pinia**
- **Tailwind CSS** `4.x`

## ‚úÖ Features Implemented
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Fetch API to Get Complete Nested Folders
- On page load, the frontend requests all folders and subfolders from the API.
- The left panel displays the full folder structure.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Expand/Collapse Subfolders on Click
- Users can expand or collapse folders in the left panel by clicking an icon.
- The expanded state is managed in the frontend to maintain UI state.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Clicking a Folder Updates the Right Panel and URL

When a user clicks a folder on the left panel:
- ‚úÖ The right panel updates to display subfolders and files of the selected folder.
- ‚úÖ The URL path updates (/folder/:id) using Vue Router.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Preserve State on Reload
On reload, the frontend checks the URL parameter (folderId).
- It finds the selected folder, expands its parent folders, and updates the right panel.
- This ensures the UI remains consistent even after a refresh.
